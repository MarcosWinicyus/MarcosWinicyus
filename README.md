### Hey, I'm Marcos Winicyus! 👋

I am a **Senior Analytics Engineer** and **Technical Lead** obsessed with building high-performance data architectures that solve real-world business problems.

Currently, I work at **Nubank**, ensuring data reliability for one of the world's largest digital banking platforms. With a strong foundation in Computer Science and over 6 years of experience in the financial sector, I specialize in the convergence of **Big Data** (Spark, Kafka, Data Mesh) and **AI Engineering** (LLMs, RAG, Agentic Workflows).

### 🚀 About Me & Technical Impact

My goal is to build the "Paved Road" for data consumption, leveraging Generative AI to eliminate toil and unlock new capabilities for the business.

* **GenAI Innovation:** I don't just hype AI; I deploy it. I architected a Generative AI solution using **AWS Bedrock** and Python that automated legacy code migration, achieving an **8x acceleration** in workflows.
* **Platform Engineering:** I believe Data Engineering is Software Engineering. I implement strict Design Patterns (e.g., Decorator, Strategy) and build internal libraries to standardize jobs, reducing boilerplate code by 40%.
* **Cloud Native Architecture:** Deep expertise in **AWS Serverless** (Step Functions, Lambda) to orchestrate complex, event-driven pipelines that are resilient and agnostic to platform evolution.
